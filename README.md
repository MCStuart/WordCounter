### Behavioral Driven Development Steps:
| Behavior | Input | Output | Reasoning |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-------------:| -------: |  
| Tells you if a single character matches with another value or not | 'a' == 'a' | true |
| Detects an input value inside another more complex value and returns frequency of that occurrence | "a" == "az" ? | 1 |
| Can detect multiple instances of a comparator value inside another value | "a" --> "asdfwasd" | 2 |
| Tells you if a single word matches with another value or not | "word" == "word" | true |
| Returns the frequency of match cases of a word with a comparison value | "and" --> "Lions and tigers and bears" | 2 |
